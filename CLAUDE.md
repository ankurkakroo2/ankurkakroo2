## Repository Overview

This is a GitHub profile repository containing a single README.md file displayed on the user's GitHub profile page. It's used to showcase the user's professional identity, current focus, and learning journey.

## File Structure

- **README.md**: The main profile README displayed on GitHub. This is the only content file in the repository.

## Common Tasks

### Updating the README

When updating the README, maintain the current structure:
1. **Header section** (user introduction and current role)
2. **Current Focus** (active projects and areas of interest)
3. **Technical Expertise** (languages, platforms, systems, infrastructure, data technologies)
4. **Learning section** (active learning initiatives with progress tracking)
5. **What I Build** (high-level professional accomplishments)
6. **Connect** (links to external profiles and projects)

### Publishing Changes

After making updates to the README:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update: [describe what changed]"
git push origin main
```

The changes will be live on the GitHub profile immediately.

## Key Context

- The README includes an active **8-week AI engineering curriculum** (Dec 2025 - Feb 2026) that should be kept current
- Links to external projects (like `ai-engineering-journey`) are maintained in the Learning and Connect sections
- The focus areas reflect the user's role as Director of Engineering at HackerRank and personal learning goals
